# getcomics.info - chrome extension
Sequentially download series from getcomics.info. This is not a release by getcomics.info.
<br><br>
Allows you to add comic series along with a date. When you 'get recent' it will search for comics released since the date and download them. To avoid over-burdening getcomics.info and maintain optimal speed on individual downloads, it sequentially downloads any matching comics that have a 'download now' button released on getcomics.info since the date.<br>
Track the output via the output pane and searching/downloading status via browser tab title.
<br><br>
The date will be updated so that next time 'get recent' runs it will grab new comics since the date you last checked/downloaded.
<br><br>
Series and dates are synced to the Chrome profile.

## Early release
This release is a non-fuss and non-glossy interface which may not be updated in the future.

## Installation
Download files and install as via 'Load Unpacked' method. Be aware that there are no safety rails here and while I'm telling you this codebase is clean (and unobfuscated/non-minified for transparency), you should still read the security warning below.

### Security Warning
------
Please properly vet anything you download from the internet, including this script. It could do anything.
